Tandem

Times are hard and it is especially hard for small business. Business Barter matches businesses to each other to help them with needs that arise. A bar needs a plumber and fast! The ladies bathroom is overflowing something fierce and it’s Friday morning. This was not in the budget! If that bar owner is a member of Business Barter, he can log on to our app and look through our database of members for a helping hand. In return, Peter Plumber enjoys 5 0’clock for a month. The aim is to lighten the load on small business with small business.
